# Shopify Inventory App

This app was created for solving the Shopify inventory creation challenge outlined [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z9LZ_kZBUbg-O2MhZVVSqTmvDko5IJWHtuFmIu_Xg1A/edit#).

The steps below indicate how to set up and run this project. If you would like to skip these steps, you can visit the version I have running at [https://shopify.anishkachinthaya.com/](https://shopify.anishkachinthaya.com/).

## Running the Project

This project consists of a few componentsâ€”a MongoDB database, a Flask backend, and a React frontend.

First, download and run MongoDB from [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/).

Then, in order to run the backend of the system, make sure you have `pip` and Python 3 installed. In order to install all required libraries, run:

### `pip3 install flask flask_cors pymongo`

To run the backend, run the following command in the main directory:

### `python3 main.py`

In order to install all Node dependencies, run:

### `npm install`

Finally, to run the frontend, you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
